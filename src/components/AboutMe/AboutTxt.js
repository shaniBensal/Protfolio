Hi, my name is Shani and welcome to my protfolio! I want to start with a quote:<br />
<span>"Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is grate work.
And the only way to do so is to love what you do." </span> (Steve jobs) <br />

<p>All my life I loved to study, explore, and learn. It started in my first and continued my second degree in Plant Science in the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.
In these times I learned on myself a lot:</p>

<p>I love to learn and to work to get achievements alone and as a part of a team.<br />
Like a tree I love to stabilize in the place and deepen my roots and expand, the more I develop, the better the fruit producer.
</p>

I love to “check what the computer can do and where can I push it”, I learned it while serving as a teacher assistance in the course “Introduction to GIS”.<br />
<p>
    As my thesis got to end, I found myself more and more comfortable next to the computer starts with Python and C. But I understood that in order to make a difference in every people life I need to become a WEB application developer.
</p>
And then I found Coding Academy, an intensive bootcamp of three months where I started from JavaScript, HTML, CSS to more complex things such as: AJAX requests, FlexBox, HTML5, VUE.js, VUEX, Node.js, MongoDB, SQL. 
But more important, I learn how to be a programmer, how to design the application, be a team member, solve complex issues etc.               
And now I am looking forward to my next challenge to phase my first steps in the industry. Looking to learn new technologies where I can push my abilities further and further, and plant my roots in a good place and join your family.
